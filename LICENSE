SimplerTimes modpack is a Minecraft modpack meant to be only used for spare time purpose. 
It has no selling interest nor it has the mods' and resourcepacks' property rights. Those property belong to their respective developers. Therefore redistributing the instance file to some second-party/second-tier shady websites and claiming it 100% yours, or directly sharing it around by unofficial download links is stricly prohibited. 
As far as download links are concerned, only the following GitHub link is official:
https://github.com/MrFlov/-MultiMC-SimplerTimes-Modpack

Therefore you're (only) able to:
- (Of course) playing the modpack at your convenience, in Singleplayer as well as in Multiplayer. 
- Share the modpack to your friends, your community as long as it contains the official download link attached above. 
- Modify it at your convenience without asking, as long as it's restricted to personal use.
- Share it through videos, livestreams, screenshots, stories (any safe entertainment media). If any download link is being given in the video, it should direct to GitHub's modpack page, without ANY transitional monetizing/advertising link.

If you're willing to redesign the modpack, then releasing it while keeping the same game topic, we may talk this out first.
I won't stop you in porting the modpack to Forge as I surely won't do that.
I thank you for your understanding.
